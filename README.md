# iDoge.tk
This program runs a server on your localhost, so you can access your dogecoin wallet through a browser. Since you are requesting localhost, you don't even have to worry about information being stolen in transit! Also, it gives you full access to wallet (private key), but viewing the private key with a working internet connection is disabled, since it is possible to have screen-monitoring spyware.
